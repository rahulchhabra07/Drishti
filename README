Drishti is a software that converts printed Hindi text to Braille.

Tesseract Open source library is used as an OCR to scan and convert printed Hindi text to unicode characters.

These characters are encoded into binary strings which are used to represent alphabets in braille. Arduino is used to display the characters by blinking of corresponsing LED's.

For the functioning of this software, You should have installed Tesseract and trained it for Hindi. 

Installation tutorial for Ubuntu 14.04 is available here: http://hanzratech.in/2015/01/16/ocr-using-tesseract-on-ubuntu-14-04.html

Training tutorial is available here: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract
You can also use a script for automating training: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/tesstrain.sh

After that you need to install an Arduino board with LED's connected to pins 1 to 12.

After training, feed a JPEG image file containg printed Hindi text to the Python file. Tis creates a dialog box showing, the original image and translated text. Now click on next for displaying the text using arduino board.
